# Revenue Insights in Hospitality Domain

## Overview
This project focuses on generating revenue insights for a fictional hotel chain using **Power BI**. The goal is to help the management understand key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, occupancy percentage, and other business-specific metrics to make data-driven decisions. The project involves data transformation, modeling, dashboard creation, and stakeholder feedback.

---

## Problem Statement
The hotel chain is facing challenges in tracking sales and revenue in a dynamically growing market. The management needs a centralized dashboard to provide actionable insights into revenue, occupancy, and other key metrics. The dashboard should help identify trends, optimize pricing strategies, and improve overall business performance.

---

## Key Metrics
The dashboard focuses on the following key metrics:
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated.
- **Occupancy Percentage**: Percentage of rooms occupied.
- **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)**: Total revenue divided by the number of available rooms.
- **ADR (Average Daily Rate)**: Average rate at which rooms are sold.
- **Realization Percentage**: Percentage of bookings that result in actual stays.
- **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)**: Number of rooms available for sale on a daily basis.

---

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: For initial data exploration and cleaning.

## Data Sources
The dataset includes the following files:
- **Hotels**: Contains information about the hotels, including location, property names, and types.
- **Room Types**: Lists the different room types available (e.g., RT1, RT2).
- **Dates**: Includes a date table with information about weekdays, weekends, and other date-related attributes.
- **Bookings**: Contains detailed booking data, including check-in and check-out dates, number of guests, room types, and revenue.
- **Aggregated Bookings**: Provides aggregated data on successful bookings versus capacity for each property and room type.

---

## Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard includes the following features:
- **KPIs**: Key performance indicators such as revenue, RevPAR, occupancy percentage, and ADR displayed at the top.
- **Filters**: City, room type, date, and week number filters to slice and dice the data.
- **Trends**: Weekly trends for key metrics to identify patterns and opportunities.
- **Visuals**: Bar charts, line charts, and donut charts to visualize data.
- **Tooltips**: Hover-over tooltips to show detailed trends and insights.

## Steps to Build the Dashboard
1. **Data Import**: Import the dataset into Power BI.
2. **Data Transformation**: Clean and transform the data using Power Query.
3. **Data Modeling**: Establish relationships between tables using a star schema.
4. **DAX Calculations**: Create calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
5. **Dashboard Creation**: Build the dashboard with visuals, filters, and KPIs.
6. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Present the dashboard to stakeholders and incorporate feedback.

## Key Insights
- **Pricing Strategy**: The hotel chain does not use dynamic pricing, leading to missed revenue opportunities. Implementing weekday-weekend pricing and dynamic pricing could improve revenue.
- **Occupancy and Ratings**: There is a strong correlation between occupancy rates and average ratings. Hotels with higher ratings tend to have higher occupancy.
- **Channel Performance**: The hotel chain can optimize its online and offline channels by offering promotions and discounts to drive more bookings.

---

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Filters**: Use the city, room type, date, and week number filters to focus on specific data.
2. **KPIs**: Monitor key metrics such as revenue, RevPAR, and occupancy percentage.
3. **Trends**: Analyze weekly trends to identify patterns and opportunities.
4. **Visuals**: Use bar charts, line charts, and donut charts to visualize data and gain insights.

## Conclusion
- Gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Power BI.
- Learned how to create calculated columns and measures using DAX.
- Developed skills in building interactive dashboards that cater to business needs.
- Understood the importance of stakeholder feedback in refining analytics solutions.
